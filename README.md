## Project Aim  

Create a Shiny app, which displays histograms for your data set by stock symbol.

This part builds on your app’s ability to create histograms of log-returns for a selected stock. Add the functionality to superimpose a normal probability density function on your histograms, where the parameters are the sample mean and the sample variance of the log-returns. That is, you should display a histogram as well as a density function in the same diagram. (Do the rest of this problem after the lectures of Nov 16 and 18.) Add to your app the functionality to calculate confidence intervals for the mean log-return of a selected stock. Assume the log-returns are normally distributed. The user should be able to specify the confidence level.
